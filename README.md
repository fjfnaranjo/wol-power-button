# wol-power-button

Small Android application to send a Wake On Lan package to a single
host.

It uses a containerized build chain.

## TODO

- Create a app launcher icon to send the WOL request directly without
  opening the app.
- Publish to F-Droid.

## Acknowledgments

- WOL magic package builder/sender code was taken from from
  https://github.com/fralik/Duorem .
